## ⚙️ Prerequisites
Before starting this course, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming (variables, loops, if-else)
- Pointers and iterators to access arrays of data
- Standard C++ iterator-based algorithms (e.g., `std::for_each`, `std::transform`)
- Lambda expressions in C++
- Standard containers like `std::vector` in C++

You would not need any prior experience with CUDA programming.
